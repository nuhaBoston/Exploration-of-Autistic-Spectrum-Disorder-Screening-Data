# Exploration of Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data
Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD)- A neurodevelopment condition associated with significant healthcare costs, and early diagnosis can significantly reduce these. By creating an expedient ASD screening process that is proven to be effective at predicting Autism it would be very helpful to healthcare professionals. 


## Goals 
1. Figure out which variables, i.e. behavioral features and individual characteristics, significantly impact the screening of ASD 
2. Train separate models to fit the Autistic Spectrum Screening Data  that we were given and do validation…….
3. Evaluate and compare the models that we create to detect ASD.
4. Make suggestions on how to best improve the screening process based on our results and give recommendations on how to improve our models in the future.

## Installation

Download all three data files to the same path: 
1. Autism-Adult-Data.csv
2. analysis.Rmd

Open the file analysis in RStudio and load all packages.

** Make sure to compile files periodically to avoid bugs or compiling errors. This is an image of one of the RMarkdown chunks compiled with no errors. It is radial SVM plot **
